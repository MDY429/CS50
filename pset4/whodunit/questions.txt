01.  What’s stdint.h?
Ans: This header defines a set of integral type aliases with specific width requirements, 
     along with macros specifying their limits and macro functions to create values of these types.


02.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
Ans: uint8_t is an unsigned int of 8 bits, uint32_t is an unsigned long long, int32_t is a signed long long, and a uint16_t is an unsigned 16 bit int.


03.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
Ans: BYTE:  1 byte
     DWORD: 4 bytes
     LONG:  4 bytes
     WORD:  2 bytes

04.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? 
    Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
ANS: The first two bytes is a bitmap with the words "BM", or the hex 0x4D42.

05.  What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
Ans: bfSize is entire of file size, biSize is BITMAPINFOHEADER size.

06.  What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
Ans: The height of the bitmap, in pixels. 
     If biHeight is positive, the bitmap is a bottom-up DIB(Device-Independent Bitmaps) and its origin is the lower-left corner.
     If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB(Device-Independent Bitmaps) and its origin is the upper-left corner.

07.  What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
Ans: biBitCount. The number of bits-per-pixel.
     The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure determines the number of bits that define each pixel and the maximum number of colors in the bitmap. 

08.  Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
Ans: That's mean cannot open the file. (e.g . There is no file.)

09.  Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
Ans: This is block size.
     fread reads in from file "infile" an element of size(BITMAPFILEHEADER/BITMAPINFOHEADER/RGBTRIPLE) bytes blocks(1) number of times.
     So just need read one time to store the bytes in a buffer pointer to by bf/bi/triple.

10.  What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
Ans: 3

11.  What does fseek do?
Ans: fseek allows you to change the location of the file pointer.

12.  What is SEEK_CUR?
Ans: SEEK_CUR ia an option use in fseek to skip the offset you set, and it start from current position.
